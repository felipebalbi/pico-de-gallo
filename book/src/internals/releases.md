# Releases & Compatibility

Pico de Gallo releases are cut by hand, and compatibility depends on humans
understanding which pieces move together.

## Tag prefixes

Each published surface has its own release tag prefix:

| Component | Tag |
|-----------|-----|
| `pico-de-gallo-internal` | `internal-v*` |
| `pico-de-gallo-lib` | `library-v*` |
| `pico-de-gallo-hal` | `hal-v*` |
| `pico-de-gallo-ffi` | `ffi-v*` |
| `gallo` CLI | `application-v*` |
| `pyco-de-gallo` | `pyco-v*` |
| `pico-de-gallo-firmware` | `firmware-v*` |
| hardware artifacts | `hardware-v*` |

## What drives a release?

Releases are **manual**. A maintainer bumps each crate's
`[package].version`, updates the cross-crate dependency specs and the
`CHANGELOG.md`, merges to `main`, and then pushes one tag per component. The
tag-triggered `release-*.yml` workflows publish to crates.io / PyPI and build
the binary artifacts.

Contributors still land Conventional Commits with crate scopes such as
`feat(internal): ...` or `fix(firmware): ...` — that scoped history is what a
maintainer reads when hand-writing the CHANGELOG and deciding which crates to
bump.

> [!TIP]
> The scope is not decoration. It tells the release author what changed in each
> crate and where the version bump belongs.

## Protocol changes are lockstep changes

When the wire protocol changes, compatibility is broader than one crate tag.
The protocol crate, firmware, and every host-facing crate must move in the same
release cycle.

That means coordinating:

- `pico-de-gallo-internal`,
- `pico-de-gallo-firmware`,
- `pico-de-gallo-lib`,
- `pico-de-gallo-hal`,
- `pico-de-gallo-ffi`,
- `pico-de-gallo-app`,
- `pyco-de-gallo`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nothing enforces wire coupling for you. If a protocol change lands without its
> matching host and firmware version bumps, users will feel it.

## How users check compatibility

There are two main compatibility checks:

- `gallo version` prints firmware version, schema version, hardware revision,
  and capabilities.
- `PicoDeGallo::validate()` checks compatibility programmatically and fails with
  `SchemaMismatch` or `LegacyFirmware` when the pair should not talk.

For most users, `gallo version` is the first stop. For library users,
`validate()` is the guardrail you call before doing real work.

## “I flashed new firmware and now my host is broken”

That usually means the firmware and host were built against different versions
of `pico-de-gallo-internal`.

Typical symptoms include:

- `validate()` returning `SchemaMismatch`,
- a new firmware exposing endpoints an older host does not know about,
- older firmware lacking `device/info`, which shows up as `LegacyFirmware`.

The fix is simple: upgrade the matching host component for the firmware you
flashed, or downgrade the firmware to the host release you are using.

> [!CAUTION]
> The protocol is typed, not best-effort. A mismatched pair is expected to fail
> fast instead of guessing.

## MSRV and release hygiene

The workspace tracks Rust 1.90 as its MSRV, and CI checks it explicitly. That
includes the host workspace and the firmware workspace.
