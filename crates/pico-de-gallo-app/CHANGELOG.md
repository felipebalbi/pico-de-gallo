## [0.10.0](https://github.com/felipebalbi/pico-de-gallo/compare/application-v0.6.0...application-v0.10.0) (2026-06-12)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **internal,firmware,lib,hal,ffi,application,pyco:** pico-de-gallo-internal gains the `system/reset-subscriptions` endpoint; postcard-rpc requires firmware and every host crate to be rebuilt against the matching SCHEMA_VERSION_MINOR. Mixing a 0.5.x firmware with a 0.6.x host (or vice versa) will fail `validate()` with a schema-version mismatch. Additionally, the FFI handle-borrowing entry points now take `*const PicoDeGallo`; this is source-compatible for C consumers but technically a signature change.

### Features

* **application:** bump for lockstep release with internal 0.7 ([b08b672](https://github.com/felipebalbi/pico-de-gallo/commit/b08b67288ef0974f854365f846b91ba0538d6e2b))
* **internal,firmware,lib,hal,ffi,application,pyco:** address P1 review findings ([00ea9df](https://github.com/felipebalbi/pico-de-gallo/commit/00ea9dfde78dd8ec531cfdd986b7205671d2ae25))
* **lib,hal,ffi,application,pyco:** enforce schema validation, expose HAL recovery ([c8e2f13](https://github.com/felipebalbi/pico-de-gallo/commit/c8e2f13be1bacf83e905d9e1453f6ec4b3abc69c))
* **lib:** add gpio_wait_for_*_with_timeout, bump internal to 0.7 ([9840232](https://github.com/felipebalbi/pico-de-gallo/commit/98402325a49a21f773d30fba7007c2da8addd698))

* **application:** call validate() before every device-touching subcommand ([33f8ff3](https://github.com/felipebalbi/pico-de-gallo/commit/33f8ff3e4810f5e1922b16252d93b4554d1af3e7))

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (2026-06-04 — Category A hotfix host-only PR)

- `gallo` now calls `validate()` at the top of every subcommand
  except `list` and `version`. Previously the CLI connected
  lazily and surfaced schema-version mismatches as confusing
  `CommsFailed` errors on the first RPC; now the mismatch is
  reported up-front with an actionable error message that
  points at `gallo version` for the device-reported schema and
  recommends either re-flashing the firmware or installing a
  matching `gallo` build. Closes Category A finding #4 (reviewer
  R4) at the CLI layer.

  `list` is exempt because it doesn't touch a connected device.
  `version` is exempt because it IS the diagnostic subcommand
  that reports schema skew (it already handles legacy firmware
  via `device_info()` with fallback).

### Changed (2026-06-04 — Category A hotfix host-only PR)

- Bumped `pico-de-gallo-lib` dependency to 0.7.1 (validate() now
  also checks `schema_major`, so any future major-version skew
  surfaces immediately rather than silently mis-decoding wire
  bytes).

### Changed (2026-06-03 — Category A hotfix wire PR, already on main as 0.8.0)

- Bumped `pico-de-gallo-lib` dependency to 0.7.0. Required for
  lockstep release with the wire-protocol schema bump in
  `pico-de-gallo-internal` 0.7.0 / `pico-de-gallo-firmware` 0.11.0
  (`timeout_ms` field on `GpioWaitRequest`, `GpioError::Timeout`
  variant).
- Existing `gallo` CLI behavior is unchanged in this release: the
  pre-existing `gpio` subcommands (`get`, `put`, `set-config`,
  `monitor`) all keep working. The CLI does not currently expose
  `gpio wait-for-*` subcommands, so no new flags are added here.
  Bounded waits remain accessible to Rust / C / Python consumers
  via `pico-de-gallo-lib`, `pico-de-gallo-hal`, and `pico-de-gallo-ffi`.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added

- `gallo version` now shows schema version, HW revision, and
  capabilities with graceful fallback for legacy firmware.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- `gallo gpio monitor --pin N --edge rising|falling|any` command.
  Subscribes, prints edge events with timestamps, unsubscribes on
  Ctrl+C.
- `gallo i2c batch` and `gallo spi batch` CLI commands for
  executing batched operations (e.g.,
  `--op write:0x00,0x10 --op read:16`).
- `gallo pwm` subcommand group with `set-duty`, `get-duty`,
  `enable`, `disable`, `set-config`, and `get-config` commands.
- `gallo adc` subcommand group with `read` and `info` commands.
- `gallo onewire` subcommand group with `reset`, `read`, `write`,
  `write-pullup`, and `search` commands.
- `gallo uart` subcommand group with `read`, `write`, `flush`,
  `set-config`, and `get-config` commands.
- `gallo i2c scan` now uses the dedicated scan endpoint (single
  round-trip) instead of 112 individual reads.
- `gallo gpio set-config`, `gallo gpio get`, and `gallo gpio put`
  subcommands for direct GPIO access from the command line.
- `gallo i2c get-config` and `gallo spi get-config` subcommands.

## [0.4.0] — 2025-04-20

### Breaking Changes

- CLI `set-config` command replaced by `i2c set-config` and
  `spi set-config` subcommands.

### Added

- `list` command to show connected devices with serial numbers.

### Changed

- `I2cFrequency` exposed as `--frequency standard|fast|fast-plus`
  CLI arg.

## [0.2.1] — 2025-03-15

### Fixed

- Bumped library dependency for latest fixes.
