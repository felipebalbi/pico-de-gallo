# Changelog

All notable changes to `pico-de-gallo-firmware` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added (2026-06-03 — Category A hotfix)

- `gpio_wait_for_*` handlers now honor the per-request `timeout_ms`
  field added in `pico-de-gallo-internal` 0.7. A value of `0`
  preserves the pre-0.7 wait-forever behavior. Non-zero wraps the
  embassy `wait_for_*_edge()` future in
  `embassy_time::with_timeout(Duration::from_millis(timeout_ms))`
  and returns `GpioError::Timeout` on expiry.
- Embassy-rp watchdog enabled at 2-second timeout, fed every
  800 ms by a dedicated `watchdog_feeder_task`. `pause_on_debug(true)`
  is set so debugger sessions don't reset the chip. Recovers the
  device from any future handler hang regression (1-Wire PIO
  stalls, embassy-rp peripheral bugs, etc.). The feeder is a
  separate embassy task — RPC handlers cannot be trusted to feed
  because a wedged handler would also wedge any handler-based
  feed scheme (see closed dispatcher-wedge regression below).

### Fixed (2026-06-03 — Category A hotfix)

- `i2c_scan_handler` now wraps each per-address probe in
  `with_timeout(Duration::from_millis(50))`. A single stuck
  address (slave NAKs slowly, electrical issue, etc.) no longer
  burns the entire scan budget. The watchdog feeder task runs
  independently so the device stays alive even during long scans.

### Why

- Closes the dispatcher-wedge regression where a `gpio_wait_for_*`
  on a never-transitioning pin blocked **every other endpoint**
  until power-cycle (reliability finding B1, captured in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-pico-de-gallo-category-a-review-synthesis.md`).
- Closes the no-recovery-from-handler-hang gap (reliability
  finding R5).
- Reduces worst-case impact of a flaky I²C bus on `i2c_scan`
  (reliability finding B2 / #33).

### Lockstep

- Coupled to `pico-de-gallo-internal` 0.7.0 (schema minor bump
  adding `timeout_ms` to `GpioWaitRequest` and `GpioError::Timeout`
  variant). See AGENTS.md §6.5.

## [Unreleased — earlier]

### Added

- `system/reset-subscriptions` endpoint handler. Firmware iterates
  its GPIO monitor slots, signals stop on each live one, awaits the
  `Flex` pin back from the monitor task, and returns it to
  `Context`. Idempotent and cheap when no subscriptions are active.
  The endpoint is the recovery path for the leak described in P1-3:
  a host process that crashed without sending `gpio/unsubscribe`
  would previously strand the affected pins until a power cycle.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added

- `hw-rev1` and `hw-rev2` Cargo feature flags (mutually exclusive).
  `hw-rev1` is the default and matches the current v1 landing
  board. Unsupported peripherals (UART, ADC, 1-Wire on v1) return
  `Unsupported` errors instead of silently failing.
- `device_info_handler` returning firmware version, schema version,
  hardware revision, and capabilities bitfield. Capabilities are
  gated by hardware revision feature flag.
- Hardware v1.1 landing board — single keyed 2×12 (0.1″ pitch)
  shrouded header replacing the seven individual connectors of
  v1.0. Routes all 20 firmware signals (UART, SPI CS, 1-Wire, ADC
  now connected). On-board passives: 4.7 kΩ I²C pull-ups (R1/R2),
  100 Ω ADC series resistors (R3–R5), 100 nF decoupling capacitor
  (C1). VREF pin hardwired to 3.3 V. Uses `hw-rev2` firmware.

### Changed

- `release-firmware.yml` now generates the `.uf2` with
  [`elf2uf2-rs`](https://github.com/JoNil/elf2uf2-rs) instead of
  downloading `picotool` from the `pico-sdk-tools` release tarball.
  The tool is installed from git (`cargo install --git ...
  --locked`) because the published crates.io 2.2.0 release does not
  yet expose the `--family` CLI option. The conversion uses
  `--family rp2350-arm-ns` (non-secure Cortex-M33; TrustZone is not
  enabled). Output artifact names (`firmware-{rev1,rev2}.uf2` and
  `pico-de-gallo-firmware-{rev1,rev2}` ELF) are unchanged.
- Renamed firmware crate package from `pico-de-gallo-fw` to
  `pico-de-gallo-firmware` (matches the directory name). The
  release ELF asset uploaded by `release-firmware.yml` is now
  `pico-de-gallo-firmware-{rev1,rev2}` (was
  `pico-de-gallo-fw-{rev1,rev2}`). The `firmware-{rev1,rev2}.uf2`
  artifact name is unchanged.
- CI: `nostd.yml` now builds and lints firmware for both `hw-rev1`
  and `hw-rev2`. `release-firmware.yml` produces per-revision
  release assets (`firmware-rev1.uf2`, `firmware-rev2.uf2`).

### Fixed

- Pin `embassy-usb-driver = "=0.2.0"` to work around an upstream
  incompatibility — `embassy-usb-driver 0.2.1` bumped
  `embedded-io-async` from 0.6 to 0.7, but `embassy-usb 0.5.1`'s
  CDC-ACM `embedded_io_async::ErrorType` impl still expects the 0.6
  trait. The mismatch produces an `EndpointError:
  embedded_io_async::Error` trait-bound error inside `embassy-usb`.
  We can't move to embassy-usb 0.6 because `postcard-rpc 0.12` only
  ships an `embassy-usb-0_5-server` feature.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-22

### Breaking Changes

- Reduced GPIO count from 8 (GPIO 8–15) to 4 (GPIO 8–11). GPIO
  12–15 are now reserved for PWM output. All GPIO indices are now
  0–3 instead of 0–7. (Joint firmware/internal change.)
- `gpios` field in `Context` changed from `[Flex<'static>;
  NUM_GPIOS]` to `[Option<Flex<'static>>; NUM_GPIOS]`. GPIO
  operations on a monitored pin return `GpioError::PinMonitored`.
- I2C handlers now map embassy-rp `AbortReason` variants to rich
  error types. SPI `set-config` validates frequency before applying
  (prevents panic on zero frequency).

### Added

- GPIO event monitoring via 4 pooled `gpio_monitor_task` instances.
  Subscribe takes ownership of the pin, monitors for edges, and
  publishes `GpioEvent` via `Sender::publish`. Unsubscribe returns
  the pin to the context. Static channels for
  start/stop/return/armed synchronization.
- `i2c_batch_handler` and `spi_batch_handler` with pre-validation,
  CS assertion/deassertion for SPI batches. SPI batch executes
  atomically under chip-select.
- PWM output on GPIO 12–15 (PWM slices 6–7, 4 channels).
  Frequency/phase-correct configuration with automatic
  top/divider computation. Duty-cycle compare values scaled
  proportionally when frequency changes.
- ADC support on GPIO 26–29 (4 GPIO channels). Uses
  `Adc::new_blocking` for single-shot reads.
- 1-Wire support via PIO0/SM0 on GPIO 16 using embassy-rp's
  `PioOneWire` driver. 6 async handlers. ROM search state held in
  Context.
- UART0 support via `BufferedUart` (interrupt-driven, 1024-byte
  TX/RX buffers). 5 UART handlers with timeout support on reads.
  Baud rate validation (must be > 0). Uses GPIO0 (TX) and GPIO1
  (RX).
- `i2c_scan_handler` — probes addresses by 1-byte read, collects
  responding addresses. Supports `include_reserved` flag.
- `gpio_set_config_handler` and per-pin `PinMode` tracking. Once a
  pin is configured via `gpio/set-config`, it enters explicit mode
  and get/put/wait respect the configured direction (returns
  `WrongDirection` on mismatch). Legacy auto-switching preserved
  for unconfigured pins.
- `i2c_get_config_handler` and `spi_get_config_handler` — return
  the currently active configuration. Firmware now tracks config
  values set by `set-config` endpoints.

## [0.7.0] — 2025-04-20

### Breaking Changes

- Wire protocol updated — firmware and host must be upgraded
  together.

### Changed

- Handler functions modernized with improved ergonomics.
- Buffer increased to `MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE` (4096 bytes).
- `PacketBuffers` sized to `MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE + 1024` per
  direction.

## [0.6.0] — 2025-03-15

### Added

- Updated all Embassy and postcard-rpc dependencies.
- Addressed critical safety issues and improved API ergonomics.
- Added more tests and extracted `connect()` helper.
